# SimpleGame
This contains the code utilized in a simple game utilizing graphics that I, w/ the help of 1 other student, programmed in C++ 
for a programming course at Youngstown State University.

For graphics, we used Allegro libraries and functions.

The ".cbp" file is a CodeBlocks IDE project file, just for reference.

The game is simple: Enemies and obstacles are randomly generated in each of the three rows in which the character can run.
Enemies kill the character. Obstacles set the user back a little in the level. The user must dodge all enemies and obstacles
while simultaneously collecting the fruits to advance to the next level. The number of fruits one has collected are displayed on
the screen. If the user does not collect the required number of fruits, they will lose the level. There are two levels in the game, 
with the second one generating more enemies and obstacles.
